FusionAuth Client Browser Example
====

This directly contains the minimum layout for a browser project using FusionAuth.

You will need the client downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-typescript-client/releases) as well as a script tag on your website that imports the client.

The client is namespaced under `FusionAuth` to prevent polluting the global namespace.
