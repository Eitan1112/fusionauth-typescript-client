FusionAuth Client NodeJS Example
====

This example exists as a minimal setup to get the FusionAuth Client working in the nodejs environment. 

## Requirements

* `typescript` - We use typescript in this example for type completion while we code
* `tsconfig.json` - Provides the rules for `tsc` to compile typescript, we provided a minimal example
* `example.ts` - A script that actually uses FusionAuth client

## Building

To build nodejs you will need to use `tsc`. This compiles the project to `build/example.js` and produces a sourcemap. You can then run this in nodejs.
